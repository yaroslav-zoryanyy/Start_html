        <b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="#">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright <a
            href="#">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and
        mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures
        on the mythical island of <a href="#">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a href="#">Lost Boys</a>, interacting with
        <a href="#">fairies</a>, <a href="#">pirates</a>, <a href="#">mermaids</a>,
        <a href="#">Native Americans</a>, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="#">escapism</a>. In addition to two distinct works by
        Barrie, <i><a href="#">The Little White Bird</a></i> (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in <i><a href="#">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a></i> in 1906), and the
        <a href="#">West End stage</a> play <i><a href="#">Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a></i> (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel
        <a href="#">Peter and Wendy</a>),
        the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These
        include several films, television series and many other works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Barrie commissioned a <a href="#">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href="#">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in
        <a href="#">Kensington Gardens</a> on 30 April 1912 as
        a surprise to the children of London. Six other statues have been cast from the original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter
        Pan featured on a <a href="#">series of UK postage stamps</a> issued by the <a href="#">Royal Mail</a> on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the character.
    </p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <i><a href="#">The Little White Bird</a></i> (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens",
        Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to <a href="#">Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as
        "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his
        <a href="#">stage play</a> titled <i><a href="#">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a></i>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the
        <a href="#">Duke of York's Theatre</a> in London. Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers,
        <a href="#">Hodder and Stoughton</a>, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title
        <i><a href="#">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a></i>, with the addition of illustrations by <a href="#">Arthur Rackham</a>. Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a
        <a href="#">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as <i><a href="#">Peter and Wendy</a></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought
        of him as forever a boy.
    </p>
    <h2>Physical appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play,
        Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and cobwebs. His name and playing the <a href="#">flute or pipes</a> suggest the Greek god and mythological character Pan. Barrie mentions in Peter and Wendy
        that Peter Pan still had all his "first teeth". He describes him as a "lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees". In The Little White Bird (1902)
        and Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens (1906), he is seven days old.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditionally, the character has been <a href="#">played on stage by a petite adult woman</a>. In the original productions in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that
        worn by <a href="#">Nina Boucicault</a> in 1904. This costume is exhibited at Barrie's Birthplace. The similar costume worn by
        <a href="#">Pauline Chase</a> (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the <a href="#">Museum of
        London</a>. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a red costume[11][12] but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,[13] and more so later after
        the release of Disney's animated movie.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed
        <a href="#">elf</a>-like ears, brown eyes, and reddish hair.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <i><a href="#">Hook</a></i> (1991), the character is played as an adult by <a href="#">Robin Williams</a>, with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan,
        not as Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the live-action <a href="#">2003 Peter Pan film</a>, he is portrayed by <a href="#">Jeremy Sumpter</a>, with blond hair, green eyes, bare feet and a costume made of leaves and vines.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the prequel to the main story <i><a href="#">2015 Pan film</a></i>, he is portrayed by <a href="#">Levi Miller</a>, a young boy who was left as a baby by the orphanage until he gets captured by Blackbeard's pirates and taken
        to Neverland. Here he wears just simple clothes.
